# evaluation_neighborhood_change

This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using machine learning to predict changes in neighborhoods. The ability to predict neighborhood change can help prevent negative impacts on marginalized communities, such as gentrification. However, four challenges must be addressed when creating predictive models: accuracy, granularity, bias, and expert validity.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide a framework for evaluating the performance of predictive models of neighborhood change based on the four challenges mentioned above.

## Methodology:
To illustrate the application of the evaluation framework, a case study was conducted in Buffalo, NY. The prediction task was to use historical data to predict the percentage of residential buildings that will be sold or foreclosed on in a given area over a fixed amount of time into the future.
